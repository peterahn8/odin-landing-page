# odin-landing-page

The goal of this Odin project is to build a landing page from scratch, based on these two images:

1. [Example Page](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png)
2. [Colors and Font Styles](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png)

**odin-landing-page** tests foundational HTML/CSS knowledge learned in [css-exercises](https://github.com/peterahn8/css-exercises).
